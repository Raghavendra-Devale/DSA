Identifying INPUT
You must clearly identify:

what data is given?
how many inputs?
data types (int, array, string, etc.)
can input be empty?
can input be modified?

Identifying OUTPUT
You must clearly identify:

what exactly is expected?
single value or multiple?
format matters or not?
order matters or not?

Edge Case Awareness (Basic)
You should notice, not solve:

empty input
single element
minimum / maximum values
