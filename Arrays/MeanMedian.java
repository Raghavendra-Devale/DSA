/*
 * Given an array a[ ] of size N. 
 * The task is to find the median and mean of the array elements. 
 * Mean is average of the numbers and median is the element which is smaller 
 * than half of the elements and greater than remaining half.  
 * If there are odd elements, the median is simply the middle element in the sorted array. 
 * If there are even elements, then the median is floor of average of two middle numbers in the sorted array. 
 * If mean is floating point number, then we need to print floor of it.
 * Note: To find the median, you might need to sort the array. 
 * Since sorting is covered in later tracks, we have already provided the sort function to you 
 * in the code.
